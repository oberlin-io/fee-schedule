# fee-schedule
Selects order fee by client based on four factors using Google Sheets' query function with SQL-like commands

See the image fee_schedule.png for an example excerpt of the client fee schedule. Another Sheets tab which contains daily orders queries the fee schedule based on date, type, location, and form. See [fee-query-code.md](https://github.com/oberljn/fee-schedule/blob/master/fee-query-code.md) for the query functions.
